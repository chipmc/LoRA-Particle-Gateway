# class BackgroundPublishRK 

Background publish class. You typically instantiate one of these as a global variable.

## Members

---

### void BackgroundPublishRK::start() 

Start the background publish thread. Required!

```
void start()
```

You typically call this from setup() using:

```cpp
BackgroundPublishRK::instance().start();
```

---

### void BackgroundPublishRK::stop() 

Stop the background publish thread.

```
void stop()
```

Normally you start it and never stop it, but this method is provided for special cases.

---

### bool BackgroundPublishRK::publish(const char * name, const char * data, PublishFlags flags, PublishCompletedCallback cb, const void * context) 

Publish method. Use this instead of Particle.publish().

```
bool publish(const char * name, const char * data, PublishFlags flags, PublishCompletedCallback cb, const void * context)
```

#### Parameters
* `name` Event name to publish (required)

* `data` Event data (optional). Must be a c-string (null-terminated) if non-NULL. Maximum length varies by Device OS, currently 622 bytes. Note that the data must be UTF-8; you cannot send arbitrary binary data!

* `flags` The publish flash. Default = PRIVATE. You will often use `PRIVATE | WITH_ACK` but can also use `PRIVATE | NO_ACK`.

* `cb` The callback function to call when the publish completes. Optional. Pass NULL or omit the parameter if you don't need a callback. It can be a C function or a C++11 lambda.

* `context` Optional parameter passed to the callback. You can store a C++ object instance or a state structure pointer here.

---

### void BackgroundPublishRK::lock() 

Used internally to mutex lock to safely access data structures from multiple threads.

```
void lock()
```

You do not need to use this under normal circumstances as publish() handles this internally.

---

### void BackgroundPublishRK::unlock() 

Used internally to mutex lock to safely access data structures from multiple threads.

```
void unlock()
```
